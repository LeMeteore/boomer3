Simple tiny demonstration of how to extend the default User class by 
- creating a class UserProfile that will contain all the informations we want to add to User.
- adding a post save signal that will create a user profile after user is created.
- setting the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE.
- updating the admin interface to see the new informations.
